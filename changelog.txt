0.1.0 (released 11-2-2014)

Now based on a very minimal Debian Packer script (ror.sh at

The test_rvm.sh script now provided in this Vagrant setup confirms that RVM is activated and works.
Virtual machine now includes a time stamp at /home/vagrant/timestamp.txt, which will be listed here in every new 
release.
