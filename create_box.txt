INSTALLING DEBIAN
1.  Go to https://www.debian.org/CD/http-ftp/#stable, select the i386 option, and download the netinstall version of
Debian Linux.  Make sure that your ISO file has the expected md5sum value.
2.  Create a new virtual machine in VirtualBox called vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm.  Set the memory to 512 MB, set the
disk size to 10 GB, and use the default values for all other parameters you are prompted for.
3.  In VirtualBox, select the vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm machine, and go to Settings -> Audio.  Uncheck "Enable Audio".
4.  In VirtualBox, select the vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm machine, and go to Settings -> USB.  Uncheck "Enable USB
Controller".
Select the "Show At Top Of Screen" option for the toolbar
5.  In VirtualBox, select the vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm machine, and go to Settings -> General -> Advanced.  
Select the "Show At Top Of Screen" option for the toolbar.
6.  In VirtualBox, select the vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm machine, and go to Settings -> Storage.  Set the IDE
controller (the virtual CD/DVD drive) to boot from the Debian Linux ISO file you downloaded.
7.  In VirtualBox, select the vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm machine, and click on the Start button to boot up.
8.  Install Debian in the virtual machine.  Select your language (English for me), your territory (USA for me), and 
time zone (Central Time for me).  Set the host name as "vagrant-debian-wheezy-rvm".  Set the domain name as 
"vagrantup.com".  Set the root password, user login, and user password as "vagrant".  Use the default values for all
other options.
9.  When the Debian installer gives you the software selection menu, select ONLY the standard system utilities, and 
unselect all other options.
10.  After Debian is installed and rebooted, log in when prompted.  Then enter the command "sudo poweroff".
11.  Once your virtual machine is shut down, save a snapshot of the current state.

CONFIGURING DEBIAN
1.  Log in to your Debian virtual machine.
2.  As root, enter the following commands to update and install the necessary packages:
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install -y build-essential module-assistant
m-a prepare
apt-get install -y sudo zerofree openssh-server
3.  As root, set up ssh by entering the following commands:
mkdir /home/vagrant/.ssh
cd /home/vagrant/.ssh
wget https://raw.github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/keys/vagrant.pub
mv vagrant.pub authorized_keys
cd -
chmod 700 /home/vagrant/.ssh
chown -R vagrant:vagrant /home/vagrant/.ssh
4.  As root, enter the command "visudo" to edit the sudo configuration.  Add the line 
"vagrant ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" and save.  When you are back in the command line, enter the command 
"/etc/init.d/sudo restart".
